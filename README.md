### Our highest accuracy occured at k = 4; however, it was very close to the accuracy of most other k values besides 1. I believe, if everything was done properly on my end, this would be because of the dataset. While it makes sense for one centroid to do badly, you would expect three to be significantly better than the rest. This may be because the dataset does not have enough data, or does not have good enough data for creating a strong distinction between categories with this model.
